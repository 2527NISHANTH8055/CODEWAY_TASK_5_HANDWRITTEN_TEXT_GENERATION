# CODEWAY_TASK_5_HANDWRITTEN_TEXT_GENERATION

This project focuses on implementing a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten text examples, enabling it to learn the patterns and characteristics of handwritten writing styles. Once trained, the model can generate new text that resembles handwritten characters, offering a fascinating exploration into the realm of artificial creativity and text generation.
